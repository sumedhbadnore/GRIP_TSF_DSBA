# GRIP_TSF_DSBA
This repository contains a project I've worked on, while having an internship at GRIP - The Sparks Foundation

The project is based on:
# Linear Regression with Python Scikit Learn
# TASK 1-Prediction using Supervised ML
Predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours using the Simple Linear Regression model.

Also predict the percentage of the student if he/she studies 9.25 hrs/day.
